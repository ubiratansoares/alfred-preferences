# Alfred Preferences
> _A backup for my Alfred settings_

## Why

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is one of the most awesome apps for MacOS. I've been using it since 2010 and I'm a happy supporter of this product. If you have a Mac and don't have the Powerpack for Alfred, do yourself a favor : just buy it now ðŸ’¯ 

## Setup

A reminder for my future self :

- Make sure you have [Roboto typeface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) installed (required by custom theme I use)
- Clone this repository
- Copy files to your home folder

```bash
cd && git clone git@github.com:ubiratansoares/alfred-preferences.git 
mv alfred-preferences .alfred
```
- Configure **Alfred** to use `~/.alfred` as your preferences folder
- Profit
